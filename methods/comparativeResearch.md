# Comparative Research
Also known as competitive research

"the analyst must determine who the competitors are, what aspects should be compared, and how to compare them." 
- Identify and profile the competition.
- Define a set of key dimensions for comparison.
- Compare competitors to each other (and to your product).
- Use the comparisons to create recommendations for action.

Explore further tools of interaction design as:
Processing, Adobe XD, Figma, Sketch, Zeplin, InVision, Marvel.

## Outcomes
1. Develop a set of technical and theoretical tools to develop interactive artifacts
2. Apply methods and theories to the design practice
3. Learn to structure an interaction design process
